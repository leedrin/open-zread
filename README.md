## 💡 Showcase

Open Zread is an open-source recreation and spiritual successor to [zread.ai](https://zread.ai/). It's not just a documentation generator — it's an **open-source codebase navigator**.

- 🚀 **Onboarding New Projects** → Face tens of thousands of lines of "legacy code with zero docs"? Run once and get a Wiki with clear module boundaries and architecture diagrams.
- ✍️ **Liberate Developers** → No need to write comments while coding. AI automatically extracts interfaces, dependencies, and best-practice usage examples.
- 🤝 **Seamless Team Handoffs** → New team members can instantly grasp the big picture from the Wiki — knowing where core modules are and who calls what.
- 🔄 **Refactoring Companion** → Re-run after code changes. With incremental caching, your old Wiki gets refreshed at lightning speed.
- 🌍 **Multi-Language Support** → Built on `web-tree-sitter`, with full support for TS/JS, Go, Rust, Python, Java, and C++.

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Requirements**: Node.js >= 18

**1. Install globally**

```bash
npm i -g @open-zread/cli
```

**2. Run in any project root directory**

```bash
open-zread
```

🎉 **That's it!**
Once inside the geeky terminal UI:
1. Enter your LLM API Key (supports 75+ providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, etc.).
2. Click `Generate Documentation`.
3. Wait a moment, and a beautifully formatted `Wiki/` Markdown folder with Mermaid architecture diagrams will be generated in your project directory!

**Or download directly (no Node.js required)**:

| Platform | Download |
|----------|----------|
| Windows x64 | [open-zread-windows-x64.exe](https://github.com/leedrin/open-zread/releases/latest/download/open-zread-windows-x64.exe) |
| macOS ARM | [open-zread-darwin-arm64](https://github.com/leedrin/open-zread/releases/latest/download/open-zread-darwin-arm64) |
| Linux x64 | [open-zread-linux-x64](https://github.com/leedrin/open-zread/releases/latest/download/open-zread-linux-x64) |

**Preview Wiki in Browser**:

```bash
open-zread browse
```

Automatically starts a local web server for immersive Wiki reading in your browser — sidebar navigation, Mermaid diagram rendering, and code highlighting, all in one place.

## 🥊 Why Open Zread?

There are countless documentation tools out there, but they all have fatal flaws. Open Zread was born to solve them:

| Approach | Pain Point | 🌟 Open Zread's Solution |
|------|------|------------|
| **Manual Documentation** | Time-consuming, quickly outdated, nobody wants to write it | AI automatically scans and generates; re-run after code changes to sync updates |
| **Copilot / Cursor** | Only chats based on current file, lacks global perspective | Unique **Three-Layer Repo Map** builds a god's-eye view of global understanding |
| **Mintlify / JSDoc** | Only supports frontend ecosystem, backend is out of luck | AST-level parsing with full support for Go/Rust/Python/Java |
| **Closed-source AI Doc SaaS**| Expensive monthly subscriptions and code leakage risks | **Fully open-source and free**, runs locally, your data never leaves your machine |
| **Traditional RAG Generation**| Just summarizes README, resulting in dry and hollow content | Parallel Agents **adaptively generate** APIs and architecture diagrams based on actual code patterns |

## ⚙️ How It Works

We don't just dump code into an LLM. Instead, we simulate how a top-tier architect reads source code:

```text
Your Codebase
   │
   ├── 1. Scan ────── glob + .gitignore to precisely locate all source files
   │
   ├── 2. Parse ────── web-tree-sitter parses AST, extracts exports and signatures
   │
   ├── 3. Cache ────── Symbol-level hash verification, skip unchanged files to save time and money
   │
   ├── 4. Blueprint ─ Agent builds three-layer Repo Map with progressive analysis:
   │   │                ├─ Layer 1: Directory Topology → Establish macro architecture
   │   │                ├─ Layer 2: Core Signatures → Find frequently referenced interfaces
   │   │                └─ Layer 3: Deep Dive → Define business boundaries, generate wiki.json
   │
   └── 5. Create ────── N parallel Page Agents read real code for each module,
                      adaptively render Mermaid diagrams, and produce top-tier Markdown docs!
```
